This git repo keeps track of customized linux configuration files, to enable me to get set up on a new computer quicker. There could potentially be something worth sharing here, but this is primarily private. I'm writing this just to ensure that markdown is straightforward. Also, there's a separate repo for emacs-related stuff [here](https://github.com/Anapollonsky/emacsd).
